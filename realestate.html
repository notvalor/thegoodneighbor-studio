      This demo shows how a calm and structured layout supports a small real estate team:
      a clear hero, one featured listing, current listings, client quotes, and a direct contact block.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      All names, addresses, and prices are fictional. The tone and structure mirror what a real small-team website would use.
